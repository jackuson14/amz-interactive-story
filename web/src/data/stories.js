She looked in the mirror and saw a very straight, serious mouth. \"Oh no!\" she whispered. Her favorite yellow dress didn't feel as sunny, and even her fluffy teddy bear didn't seem as cuddly without a smile to share with him. Lily decided she needed to find her smile, and she knew just where to start looking.",

Then, she looked near the busy buzzing bumblebees. She giggled at their fuzzy little bottoms, but her smile didn't come back. A little ladybug crawled onto her finger, and Lily whispered, \"Have you seen my smile?\" The ladybug just wiggled its antennae and flew away.",

She felt a little sad and stayed on the edge of the playground. A little boy on the swings looked lonely. He was just sitting there, not swinging at all. He had tears in his eyes.",

She sat on the swing next to him and started to sing her favorite silly song, the one about a duck with a polka-dot hat. She sang loudly and wiggled her toes. The little boy stopped crying and looked at her. He gave a tiny giggle. Lily kept singing, and soon the little boy was giggling even more.",

The little boy on the swing was smiling now, a big, happy smile. And when he smiled, Lily's own bright, sparkly smile popped right back! She had found it not by looking for it, but by sharing a little bit of happiness with someone else. She learned that a smile isn't something you can find—it's something you give away.",
