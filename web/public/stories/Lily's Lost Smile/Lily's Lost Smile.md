Lily had a bright, sparkly smile that could light up a whole room. But one morning, when she woke up, her smile was gone! She looked in the mirror and saw a very straight, serious mouth. "Oh no!" she whispered. Her favorite yellow dress didn't feel as sunny, and even her fluffy teddy bear didn't seem as cuddly without a smile to share with him. Lily decided she needed to find her smile, and she knew just where to start looking..

First, Lily looked in the garden. "Maybe my smile is hiding with the daisies!" she thought. She gently peeked under a big, white flower. No smile. Then, she looked near the busy buzzing bumblebees. She giggled at their fuzzy little bottoms, but her smile didn't come back. A little ladybug crawled onto her finger, and Lily whispered, "Have you seen my smile?" The ladybug just wiggled its antennae and flew away.

Next, Lily went to the park. She saw her friend Leo playing with a bright red ball. Leo was making funny faces and laughing. Lily watched him, but her serious mouth didn't move. She felt a little sad and stayed on the edge of the playground. A little boy on the swings looked lonely. He was just sitting there, not swinging at all. He had tears in his eyes.

Lily walked over to the boy. She didn't have her smile, but she had an idea. She sat on the swing next to him and started to sing her favorite silly song, the one about a duck with a polka-dot hat. She sang loudly and wiggled her toes. The little boy stopped crying and looked at her. He gave a tiny giggle. Lily kept singing, and soon the little boy was giggling even more.

As the boy's giggle grew, something amazing happened. Lily felt a tiny tingle on her serious mouth. It started to turn up, just a little bit. Then, it turned up a little more. The little boy on the swing was smiling now, a big, happy smile. And when he smiled, Lily's own bright, sparkly smile popped right back! She had found it not by looking for it, but by sharing a little bit of happiness with someone else. She learned that a smile isn't something you can findâ€”it's something you give away.
