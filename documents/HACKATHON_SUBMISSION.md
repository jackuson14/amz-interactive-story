# Polly Story: AI-Powered Interactive Storytelling for Children
### AWS Hackathon Submission - September 2024

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Polly Story** is a revolutionary AI-powered interactive storytelling platform designed to transform screen time from passive consumption to active, educational engagement for children aged 2-6. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, Polly Story creates personalized stories where children become the protagonists of their own adventures.

### Problem Statement

Modern children face significant challenges related to excessive screen time:
- **Speech and Language Delays**: Studies show correlation between passive screen consumption and developmental delays
- **Exposure to Inappropriate Content**: "Brainrot" content and algorithmically-driven feeds pose risks to young minds
- **Lack of Interactive Learning**: Traditional screen time offers minimal educational value or engagement

**Polly Story addresses these critical issues** by providing a safe, educational, and time-controlled alternative that transforms necessary screen time into valuable learning opportunities.
