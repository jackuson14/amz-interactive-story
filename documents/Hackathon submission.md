Problem Statement: 
Modern children face significant challenges related to excessive screen time:
- Speech and Language Delays: Studies show correlation between passive screen consumption and developmental delays
- Exposure to Inappropriate Content: "Brainrot" content and algorithmically-driven feeds pose risks to young minds
- Lack of Interactive Learning: Traditional screen time offers minimal educational value or engagement


Project Description:
Polly Story is a revolutionary AI-powered interactive storytelling platform designed to transform screen time from passive consumption to active, educational engagement for children aged 2-6. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, Polly Story creates personalized stories where children become the protagonists of their own adventures.
- Children see themselves integrated into the stories via AI image transformation
- Interact via üó£Ô∏è speech or üï∫üèª movement to progress in the story 
- Every story teaches new words, simple values and life lessons
- Content complexity personalization based on actual interaction from children instead of fixed age group


Technology used:
- **AWS Amplify**: Frontend hosting and deployment
- **AWS CloudFront**: Global content delivery network
- **AWS Route 53**: DNS management and domain routing
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless API endpoints
- **AWS S3**: Static asset storage and backup
- **Amazon Polly**: Superior text-to-speech with children's voices
- Gemini: Generative AI for story, graphic and interaction generation
